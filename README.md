## Welcome Defenders!

Welcome to the **Awesome Blue Team Tools** guide! This repository is a curated collection of powerful, practical, and often open-source tools focused specifically on **Blue Team operations: defense, detection, response, and analysis.**

Whether you are building a Security Operations Center (SOC), managing infrastructure security, responding to incidents, hunting for threats, or simply learning the ropes of cyber defense, this guide aims to be your go-to reference. We prioritize tools that provide real value in protecting assets and understanding attacker techniques from a defensive standpoint.

Originally born from personal notes, this project strives to be a high-quality, evolving, community-driven resource.
