## SIEM Core Concepts

* **Description:** Understanding the fundamental concepts behind SIEM systems is crucial for effective use, regardless of the specific tool chosen. Key concepts include:
    * **Log Collection:** Gathering logs from diverse sources (endpoints, network devices, firewalls, servers, applications, cloud services, threat feeds). Often uses agents (Beats, Wazuh Agent, Splunk UF) or standard protocols (Syslog, SNMP Traps, API calls).
    * **Parsing & Normalization:** Converting logs from various formats into a common, structured format (e.g., ECS - Elastic Common Schema) so they can be correlated. Extracts key fields (IP addresses, usernames, timestamps, action).
    * **Correlation:** Applying rules (e.g., Sigma rules) or statistical/ML models to analyze normalized events from multiple sources to detect patterns indicative of threats or policy violations (e.g., multiple failed logins followed by success from a new location).
    * **Alerting:** Notifying analysts when correlation rules or detection logic trigger on potentially malicious activity.
    * **Dashboarding & Reporting:** Providing visual summaries of security posture, active alerts, key metrics, and compliance status.
    * **Log Retention:** Storing logs securely for a defined period to meet compliance requirements and allow for historical investigation/forensics.
    * **Threat Hunting:** Proactively searching through log data for signs of compromise that may not have triggered automated alerts.
* **Type:** Concepts
* **Notes/Tips:** Effective SIEM implementation requires careful planning regarding log sources, normalization, rule tuning (to minimize false positives), and defining clear processes for alert triage and incident response.

## Sigma Rules

* **Description:** Sigma is an open-source, generic signature format for SIEM systems. It aims to create a standardized way to write detection rules that can then be converted to work across various SIEM platforms (Splunk, Elastic Security, QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel, Wazuh, etc.).
* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * **Vendor Agnostic:** Write detection logic once in Sigma format, then convert it for your specific SIEM using converters (like `sigmac`).
    * **Community Sharing:** Enables easy sharing of detection rules between different organizations and researchers, regardless of the SIEM tool used.
    * **Structured Format:** YAML-based rules are human-readable and define log source, detection logic (keywords, fields, conditions), severity, TTP mapping (MITRE ATT&CK), etc.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) (Rule repository), [https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigmac](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigmac) (Converter)
* **Type:** SIEM Rule Format / Standard
* **Platform(s):** N/A (Format definition). Rules used within SIEMs. Converter (`sigmac`) is Python-based.
* **Installation:** Rules are downloaded/cloned from GitHub. `sigmac` installed via pip.
* **Basic Usage Example:**
    ```yaml
    # Example Sigma Rule Snippet (powershell_suspicious_download.yml)
    title: Suspicious PowerShell Download Activity
    status: stable
    description: Detects PowerShell downloading files using specific methods often used for malware staging.
    logsource:
        product: windows
        service: powershell # Or sysmon Event ID 1 for process creation
    detection:

            # Example for Sysmon Event ID 1
            EventID: 1
            CommandLine|contains|all:
                - 'powershell'
                - 'Net.WebClient'
                - 'DownloadFile'
        condition: selection
    falsepositives:
        - Legitimate administrative scripts
    level: high
    tags:
        - attack.execution
        - attack.t1059.001
    ```
    * Use `sigmac` to convert rules: `sigmac -t splunk myrule.yml > splunk_query.txt`
* **Alternatives:** Vendor-specific rule languages (Splunk SPL, Elastic KQL/EQL).
* **Notes/Tips:** The SigmaHQ repository contains thousands of community rules. Contribute rules back! Essential for standardizing detection logic and leveraging community knowledge.
