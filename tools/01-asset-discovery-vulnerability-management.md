## Nmap (Network Mapper) - Blue Team Focus

* **Description:** An essential open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing *within your own environment*. Blue Teams use Nmap for network inventory (discovering hosts and services), identifying open ports that shouldn't be, validating firewall rules, and detecting known vulnerabilities using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE).
* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * **Network Inventory:** Discovering live hosts (`-sP`/`-sn`) and running services (`-sV`) on your internal or external networks.
    * **Port Scanning:** Identifying open TCP/UDP ports on your assets.
    * **Service & Version Detection:** Understanding exactly what software and versions are running on discovered ports (crucial for vulnerability correlation).
    * **OS Detection:** Identifying operating systems of assets within your network.
    * **Vulnerability Detection (NSE):** Running scripts (`--script vuln`) to check for specific known vulnerabilities associated with detected services/versions.
    * **Firewall Rule Auditing:** Testing if firewall rules are correctly blocking or allowing traffic.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://nmap.org/](https://nmap.org/)
* **Type:** CLI (Command-Line Interface), GUI available (Zenmap)
* **Platform(s):** Linux, Windows, macOS
* **Installation:**
    ```bash
    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
    # ... other platforms ...
    ```
* **Basic Usage Example (Blue Team Scenarios):**
    ```bash
    # Ping scan to discover live hosts on your subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) - Requires root/admin usually
    sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

    # Discover hosts, open ports, services/versions, and OS on your subnet (can be noisy)
    sudo nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.0/24 -oA nmap_subnet_scan_$(date +%Y%m%d)
    # (-oA saves output in all formats)

    # Scan a specific internal server for common ports and known web vulnerabilities
    sudo nmap -sV --script=http-vuln* 192.168.1.50 -p 80,443

    # Scan your external IP for commonly exposed ports from the outside
    nmap -sV YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP
    ```
* **Alternatives:** Masscan, RustScan (for speed), dedicated vulnerability scanners (OpenVAS, Nessus).
* **Notes/Tips:** Always ensure you have permission to scan networks, even internal ones. Use `-oA` to save results for documentation. `-T4` speeds things up but can be noisy; adjust timing if needed. Focus on understanding *your* assets and their potential weaknesses. Use `nmap --script list` to explore available NSE scripts.
