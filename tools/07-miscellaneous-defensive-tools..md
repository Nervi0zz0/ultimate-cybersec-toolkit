## Osquery

* **Description:** An open-source framework created by Facebook that exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database. It allows you to write SQL-based queries to explore OS data like running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events, file hashes, and much more. Enables low-level OS monitoring and analytics.
* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * **Endpoint Visibility:** Provides deep visibility into endpoint state using familiar SQL syntax.
    * **Threat Hunting:** Write queries to hunt for indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior across a fleet of endpoints.
    * **Compliance Auditing:** Query system configurations to check against security policies.
    * **Incident Response:** Quickly query live systems for specific forensic artifacts during an investigation.
    * **Extensibility:** Supports custom extensions and integrates with log aggregation/SIEM systems.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://osquery.io/](https://osquery.io/), [https://github.com/osquery/osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)
* **Type:** Endpoint Instrumentation / Query Engine (Agent + CLI `osqueryi`)
* **Platform(s):** Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD.
* **Installation:** Installers and packages available from the official website.
* **Basic Usage Example (`osqueryi` interactive shell):**
    ```sql
    -- See current logged in users
    SELECT * FROM logged_in_users;

    -- Find processes listening on network ports
    SELECT pid, name, port, address FROM listening_ports WHERE address != '127.0.0.1';

    -- Find processes running without a binary on disk (potential memory injection)
    SELECT pid, name, path FROM processes WHERE on_disk = 0;

    -- Check USB devices connected
    SELECT * FROM usb_devices; 
    ```
* **Alternatives:** Sysinternals Suite (Windows, different approach), commercial EDR agents (often include similar query capabilities), Auditd (Linux native auditing).
* **Notes/Tips:** Osquery is typically deployed as a daemon (`osqueryd`) configured to run scheduled queries and log results centrally. The interactive shell (`osqueryi`) is great for exploration and developing queries. Understanding the table schema is key.

## Snyk

* **Description:** A developer security platform focused on finding and fixing vulnerabilities and license issues in open source dependencies, container images, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations, and proprietary code. Integrates into developer workflows (IDE, Git repos, CI/CD).
* **Key Features/Why it's useful (for Blue Team / DevSecOps):**
    * **Dependency Scanning:** Identifies known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in project dependencies (npm, Maven, pip, etc.).
    * **Container Image Scanning:** Finds vulnerabilities in OS packages and application layers within container images.
    * **IaC Scanning:** Detects misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests.
    * **Code Scanning (SAST):** Finds security flaws in proprietary application code.
    * **Prioritization & Remediation:** Provides context on vulnerabilities and suggests fixes or upgrades.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://snyk.io/](https://snyk.io/)
* **Type:** Developer Security Platform (Web UI, CLI, IDE Plugins, API) (Commercial with Free Tier)
* **Platform(s):** Web Platform; CLI/plugins work on Windows, macOS, Linux.
* **Installation (CLI):** Requires npm, or download binary.
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install -g snyk
    # Authenticate (connects to your Snyk account)
    snyk auth
    ```
* **Basic Usage Example (CLI):**
    ```bash
    # Test a project's dependencies in the current directory
    snyk test

    # Monitor dependencies and get alerts on new vulnerabilities
    snyk monitor

    # Scan a container image
    snyk container test your-image:tag

    # Scan Infrastructure as Code files
    snyk iac test path/to/iac/files/
    ```
* **Alternatives:** OWASP Dependency-Check (Dependencies), Trivy/Grype (Containers/Filesystems), SonarQube (SAST), GitHub Advanced Security, commercial SCA/SAST tools.
* **Notes/Tips:** Free tier is generous for open source projects and limited private use. Integrates well into CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early ("shift left" security). Helps Blue Teams ensure software deployed is secure from the start.

## STIX / TAXII

* **Description:** Not tools themselves, but crucial standards for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).
    * **STIXâ„¢ (Structured Threat Information Expression):** A standardized language (using JSON) for representing CTI data in a structured way (e.g., threat actors, campaigns, indicators, TTPs, vulnerabilities, relationships).
    * **TAXIIâ„¢ (Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information):** An application protocol for exchanging STIX data over HTTPS, defining APIs for sharing CTI between systems.
* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * **Interoperability:** Enables different CTI tools and platforms (like MISP, OpenCTI, commercial TIPs) to share and understand threat intelligence automatically.
    * **Automation:** Facilitates automated ingestion and dissemination of threat feeds.
    * **Standardization:** Provides a common language for describing threats, improving clarity and consistency.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [OASIS Open Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti) (Governing body for STIX/TAXII standards)
* **Type:** Standards (Language & Protocol)
* **Platform(s):** N/A
* **Installation:** N/A (Implemented by CTI tools/platforms and libraries like `stix2` for Python).
* **Basic Usage Example:** Used implicitly when configuring CTI tools like MISP or OpenCTI to connect to TAXII servers or import/export STIX bundles. Analysts might view data represented in STIX format within these platforms.
* **Alternatives:** Proprietary vendor formats (less interoperable), simple IOC lists (CSV, text - less structured).
* **Notes/Tips:** Understanding the basic concepts of STIX (objects like Indicator, Malware, Threat Actor, Relationship) and TAXII (Collections, Channels, API Roots) helps when configuring CTI platform integrations. These standards are the backbone of modern threat intelligence sharing.
