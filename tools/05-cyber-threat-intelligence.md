# 5. ðŸ§  Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Cyber Threat Intelligence involves collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about current and potential threats targeting an organization. For Blue Teams, CTI provides context about adversaries, their motivations, capabilities, infrastructure (Indicators of Compromise - IOCs), and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This understanding helps prioritize defenses, improve detection capabilities, and speed up incident response.

## Maltego

* **Description:** A powerful graphical link analysis tool used for gathering and connecting open-source intelligence (OSINT) and threat intelligence. It visualizes relationships between pieces of information (like domains, IPs, emails, names, malware hashes) using "Transforms" that query various public and commercial data sources.
* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * Visualizing complex relationships between different IOCs and intelligence data points.
    * Automating data gathering from diverse sources via Transforms (e.g., WHOIS, DNS records, Shodan, VirusTotal, Passive DNS).
    * Identifying hidden connections and infrastructure patterns.
    * Exploring threat actor infrastructure or mapping an organization's external footprint graphically.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://www.maltego.com/](https://www.maltego.com/)
* **Type:** Graphical Link Analysis / Intelligence Visualization Platform (Commercial, with free Community Edition)
* **Platform(s):** Windows, macOS, Linux (Java-based).
* **Installation:** Download installer from website. Requires registration. Community Edition is free but has limitations (e.g., number of results per Transform).
* **Basic Usage Example:** Start a new graph. Drag entities (e.g., Domain, IP Address) onto the graph. Run Transforms on entities to query data sources and discover related entities (e.g., run DNS transforms on a domain to find IPs, run reverse DNS on IPs to find other domains). Analyze the resulting graph for connections.
* **Alternatives:** OpenCTI (Data storage/linking, less visualization focus), SpiderFoot (Automation focus), custom scripting + visualization libraries (more effort).
* **Notes/Tips:** The power of Maltego lies in the Transforms available (both built-in and installable from the Transform Hub). Community Edition is useful for learning but professional use often requires paid versions for access to more data sources and fewer limitations.

* **Type:** Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) / Sharing Platform (Web UI)
* **Platform(s):** Linux (Server application, typically Ubuntu/Debian). Often deployed as a VM or Docker container.
* **Installation:** Follow detailed official installation guide. Requires LAMP stack components (or similar) and dependencies.
* **Basic Usage Example:** Accessed via web interface. Involves creating "Events" which contain "Attributes" (IOCs) and contextual information (Galaxies). Explore existing events, add indicators found during investigations, configure feeds from external sources or other MISP instances.
* **Alternatives:** OpenCTI (broader CTI platform), TheHive (IR focus, integrates with MISP), commercial TIPs (Anomali, ThreatQuotient), AlienVault OTX (more community feed focused).
* **Notes/Tips:** Primarily designed for *sharing* intelligence. Setting up feeds and synchronization correctly is key. Understanding the MISP data model (Events, Attributes, Objects, Galaxies) is important for effective use.

        # Start web server
        python ./sf.py -l 127.0.0.1:5001 
        ```
        (Access `http://127.0.0.1:5001` in browser. Configure API keys in Settings. Start a New Scan, define target, select modules.)
    * **CLI:**
        ```bash
        # Run a scan on a domain using all modules, output to stdout
        python ./sf.py -s yourdomain.com -u ALL 
        ```
* **Alternatives:** Recon-ng (CLI, modular framework), Maltego (GUI, visualization focus), custom scripts.

* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * **Case Management:** Centralized platform for managing security incidents.
    * **Collaboration:** Allows multiple analysts to work on the same case simultaneously.
    * **Observable Management:** Tracks IOCs (IPs, domains, hashes, etc.) related to a case.
    * **Task Tracking:** Assign and monitor tasks required for incident investigation and response.
    * **Integration:** Connects with MISP (for CTI sharing), Cortex (for running analyzers on observables), and other tools.
    * **Real-time Updates:** Live stream of case updates and notifications.
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://thehive-project.org/](https://thehive-project.org/), [https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive)

Add tasks for investigation (e.g., "Analyze malware sample," "Block IP on firewall"). Write log entries documenting findings. Use analyzers via Cortex (if configured) to enrich observables (e.g., VirusTotal lookup for a hash). Close case when resolved.
* **Alternatives:** Commercial SIRP/SOAR platforms (Splunk SOAR, Palo Alto XSOAR), Request Tracker (RT) for Incident Response (RTIR - Open Source ticketing system adapted for IR).
* **Notes/Tips:** TheHive shines when integrated with Cortex (for automated analysis) and MISP (for CTI enrichment/sharing). It structures the IR process and facilitates teamwork.

## YARA

* **Description:** Often called "the pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers (and everyone else)." YARA provides a rule-based language to create descriptions (rules) that identify malware or other files based on textual or binary patterns. Blue Teams use YARA rules to scan files at rest, memory dumps, or network traffic to detect known malicious patterns.
* **Key Features/Why it's useful:**
    * **Flexible Pattern Matching:** Define rules based on strings (text, hex, regex), binary patterns, and conditions.
    * **Malware Identification & Classification:** Create/use rules to detect specific malware families or characteristics.
    * **IOC Searching:** Scan large datasets (files, memory) for indicators defined in YARA rules.
    * **Extensibility:** Can be integrated into other tools (IDS, sandboxes, forensic tools).
* **Official Website/Repository:** [https://virustotal.github.io/yara/](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/), [https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)
* **Type:** Pattern Matching Engine / Rule Language (CLI Tool & Library)

    pip install yara-python
    # Or download pre-compiled binaries
    ```
* **Basic Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    # Create a simple YARA rule file (e.g., myrule.yar):
    /*
    rule HelloWorld {
      strings:
        $text = "Hello World" nocase wide ascii
      condition:
        $text
    }
    */

    # Scan a file or directory with the rule
    yara myrule.yar /path/to/scan/
    ```
* **Alternatives:** ClamAV (AV engine, uses its own signature format), commercial AV/EDR rulesets.
* **Notes/Tips:** Writing effective YARA rules requires understanding file formats and malware patterns. Many public repositories exist for sharing YARA rules (e.g., Awesome YARA). Essential skill for malware analysis and threat hunting.
